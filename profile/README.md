# LightViewJs

The goal of the organization is to create a Js CLI framework, but usable as well as a library. We want to make it possible to use different HTML compiled languages as well as HTML itself. The server saves the files in the cache so the response is more optimized and directly converted to the HTML type. The same with the CSS or JS compiled languages.

We want to create a middleware router framework for Deno and NodeJs. The goal is to respond with the possibility of generating automatic RootCA SSL certification with Certbot.
